                    <h3>FUZZY PASTELS</h3>
                    <p>The collection is truly Balmain, nothing less than you would expect from Olivier R. The quality is beyond amazing, especially those beaded dresses. I mean, don’t expect to get those for a bargain, the quality is reflected in the price, but still only a fraction of one from his own collection.</p>

                    <h3>CHANEL GIRL BAG BRINGS BOHO</h3>
                    <p>Never thought I would take this boho-thing to the next level, and then I mean next level for me, cause have you seen me really boho before? No, exactly, neither did I! I guess this slouchy bag made me go for it. It feels like the perfect bag for loose dresses, maybe even floral dresses.</p>

                    <h3>FRAME DEMIN OVERALLS</h3>
                    <p>Big fan of this FRAME Denim jumpsuit, because it’s literally the easiest to wear. Okay, I had to alter it obviously because I clearly don’t have those ultra long Forever-Karlie-legs. This on is from their AW15 collection, so the denim is too thick for me to wear in New York Summer on the street.</p>

                    <p>It’s one of those days again where I’m super excited about the look I’m posting – I’ve been waiting for this moment for two months – but I have literally nothing to write about! There are cool things happening though, and of course,too thick for me to wear cool things did happen.</p>

                    <p>When KHAITE launched in 2016, it immediately grew on me and became one of my favorite brands. With their dreamy dresses and tulle tops, it was just in line with my forever obsession over the “runaway-bride” look – aka pretty dresses and sneakers. </p>
